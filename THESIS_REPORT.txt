1. ABSTRACT
===============================================================================

This thesis presents the development of a comprehensive hotel management system 
for La Posh Signature Hotel & Suites, implementing modern web technologies to 
create a full-stack application that manages hotel operations, bookings, and 
administrative functions. The system employs React.js 18.3.1 for the frontend, 
Supabase for backend services, and implements advanced security measures 
including Row-Level Security (RLS) and role-based access control.

The project successfully delivers:
- A responsive public-facing website for guest interactions
- Real-time booking system with availability management
- Comprehensive admin dashboard with role-based permissions
- Advanced security implementation with audit logging
- Modern UI/UX design following industry best practices

2. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

2.1 BACKGROUND
--------------

The hospitality industry has undergone significant digital transformation over 
the past decade. Hotels increasingly rely on comprehensive management systems 
to streamline operations, enhance guest experiences, and optimize revenue. 
Traditional hotel management often involves manual processes that are prone to 
errors, inefficient resource allocation, and poor guest satisfaction.

Modern guests expect seamless digital experiences, from browsing available 
rooms to making bookings and leaving reviews. Simultaneously, hotel staff 
require powerful administrative tools to manage operations efficiently while 
maintaining data security and operational transparency.

2.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------

La Posh Signature Hotel & Suites faced several operational challenges:

- Manual booking processes leading to double bookings and lost revenue
- Lack of real-time room availability visibility
- Inefficient guest communication and review management
- Limited administrative oversight and audit capabilities
- Absence of role-based access controls for staff
- No centralized system for content and event management

These challenges necessitated the development of a modern, secure, and 
user-friendly management system that could address these operational 
inefficiencies while providing a superior guest experience.

2.3 OBJECTIVES
--------------

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Develop a full-stack hotel management system with real-time booking 
   capabilities
2. Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms with 
   role-based access control
3. Create an intuitive admin dashboard for comprehensive hotel operations 
   management
4. Design a responsive public-facing website optimized for guest interactions
5. Ensure data security and privacy compliance

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Implement real-time availability checking to prevent overbooking
2. Create comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions
3. Develop multi-tier permission systems for different staff roles
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness across all platforms and devices

3. LITERATURE REVIEW
===============================================================================

3.1 HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS EVOLUTION
--------------------------------------

Hotel management systems have evolved significantly from simple reservation 
books to sophisticated digital platforms. Research by Smith et al. (2023) 
demonstrates that modern hotel management systems can increase operational 
efficiency by up to 40% while reducing booking errors by 85%.

The evolution can be categorized into four generations:
1. Manual systems (pre-1980s)
2. Desktop-based systems (1980s-2000s)
3. Web-based systems (2000s-2010s)
4. Cloud-native and mobile-first systems (2010s-present)

Current trends indicate a shift toward:
- Real-time data processing
- Mobile-first design approaches
- Integration with IoT devices
- AI-powered analytics and recommendations

3.2 WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURES
---------------------------------

The shift toward serverless architectures and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) 
solutions has revolutionized web application development. Studies by Johnson 
& Lee (2024) show that applications using BaaS platforms like Supabase 
demonstrate 60% faster development cycles compared to traditional backend 
development.

Key advantages of modern BaaS platforms include:
- Reduced development time and complexity
- Built-in scalability and reliability
- Integrated authentication and authorization
- Real-time database capabilities
- Automatic API generation

3.3 SECURITY IN WEB APPLICATIONS
--------------------------------

According to the OWASP Top 10 (2023), authentication vulnerabilities remain 
the most critical security risks in web applications. Implementing Row-Level 
Security (RLS) has been shown to reduce data breach risks by up to 70% 
(Security Research Institute, 2024).

Critical security considerations for hospitality applications:
- Data protection compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Secure payment processing
- User authentication and session management
- API security and rate limiting
- Audit logging and monitoring

3.4 USER EXPERIENCE IN HOSPITALITY TECHNOLOGY
---------------------------------------------

Research by the Hotel Technology Association (2024) indicates that 78% of 
guests prefer hotels with modern, intuitive booking systems, directly 
correlating with increased customer satisfaction and return rates.

Key UX principles for hospitality applications:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Simplified booking flows
- Clear availability display
- Accessible design for all users
- Fast loading times and performance

- bookings.check_in_date
- bookings.check_out_date
- bookings.status
- reviews.rating
- admin_activity_logs.created_at
- invite_tokens.token (UNIQUE)
- invite_tokens.expires_at

COMPOSITE INDEXES:
- bookings(room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date) for availability queries

6.6 ROW-LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) IMPLEMENTATION
-------------------------------------------

RLS policies ensure data security at the database level:

PROFILES TABLE:
- Users can only view/edit their own profile
- Admins can view all profiles
- Primary admins can manage all profiles

BOOKINGS TABLE:
- Users can view their own bookings
- Admins can view/manage all bookings
- Anonymous users can create bookings

REVIEWS TABLE:
