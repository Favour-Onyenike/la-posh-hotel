Project Title: La-Posh Hotel Booking and Administrative Management System

===============================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

1.1 Statement of Problem
------------------------
The hospitality industry faces significant challenges in managing bookings, 
room availability, customer communications, and administrative operations 
efficiently. Traditional manual processes are prone to errors, double bookings, 
and inefficient resource allocation. Small to medium-sized hotels often lack 
integrated systems that can handle:

- Real-time room availability management
- Automated booking confirmation and email notifications
- Centralized customer data management
- Administrative oversight with role-based access control
- Seamless integration of booking, payment, and communication systems

This project addresses these challenges by developing a comprehensive web-based 
booking and administrative management system specifically designed for hotel 
operations.

1.2 Aims and Objectives
-----------------------
Primary Aim:
To develop a fully functional, responsive web-based hotel booking and 
administrative management system that streamlines operations and enhances 
customer experience.

Specific Objectives:
• Design and implement a user-friendly booking interface for customers
• Develop a comprehensive admin dashboard for hotel management
• Create a real-time room availability management system
• Implement automated email notification system for bookings and inquiries
• Establish secure user authentication and role-based access control
• Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility
• Integrate database management for bookings, rooms, and customer data
• Implement automated booking confirmation and management workflows

1.3 Significance of the Study
-----------------------------
This project contributes to the digitalization of hospitality management by:

• Demonstrating the practical application of modern web technologies in 
  hospitality industry solutions
• Showcasing AI-assisted development methodologies in real-world projects
• Providing a scalable solution that can be adapted for various hotel sizes
• Contributing to the body of knowledge on full-stack web development
• Illustrating the integration of multiple technologies (React, Supabase, 
  email services) in a cohesive system
• Addressing the growing need for contactless and automated hotel services 
  post-pandemic

1.4 Operational Definitions
---------------------------
• Real-time Availability: Instant updates of room status across all system 
  components without manual intervention
• Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Security mechanism that restricts system 
  access based on user roles and permissions
• Edge Functions: Serverless functions that run close to users for improved 
  performance and reduced latency
• Full-stack Development: Development approach encompassing both frontend 
  (user interface) and backend (server-side) components
• Responsive Design: Web design approach ensuring optimal viewing experience 
  across various devices and screen sizes
• RESTful API: Architectural style for web services that uses standard HTTP 
  methods for data communication
